Note: I recommend running the game in Gargoyle, an interpreter that works consistently across a number of platforms. The game will immediately crash with the Lectrote interpreter (or its derivatives). The interpreter isn’t to blame — it’s a problem buried deep in one of the somewhat dated libraries that I used in this project, one of which is not entirely glulxe compliant. As far as I know, other interpreters seems to work okay. If you run into problems, consider playing the online version, which is also better in terms of support for accessibility.

=== SOLUTION ===

Here’s the minimal solution for “En Garde”.

A few hints:

* You can’t type commands. The keyboard isn’t used in this game; chuck it out the window.
* Before tossing it, check under the window to be be sure that no one is below.
* During the game, colored boxes will appear.
* Each color coresponds to a command.
* It’s up to you to figure out what command each color represents.
* Don’t worry — you can’t put the game into an unwinnnable state, so feel free to experiment.
